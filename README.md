#TO DO
#stack_decision FINISHED
#pot FINISHED
#bet_size FINISHED
#turn to move FINISHED

check if green RNG is there, that means to start the process
process starts -> calls the bash script every second. (need to create scripts to check the txt of each directory)
each scripts returns a json of the current thing happening
first it checks the stack_decision, if they do a certain action, wait 1/2 images to see the price
