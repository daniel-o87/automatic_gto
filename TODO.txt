once RNG IS seen (bash in start_decision), it calls bash in the following order
1. dealer
  this bash updates game.txt for who is dealer button
2. stack_decision
  this bash updates player_status on who folds or is active
3. pot
  keeps the pot updated
4. turn_to_move
  not so important rn, could be used as a flag to make sure that it is our turn to move and verify if dealer button and order is correct
5. bet_size
  this should only be called if oppponent raised
